To perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset such as the Titanic dataset from Kaggle
one can follow these three steps:
-Load the dataset and conduct initial data cleaning to handle missing values and inconsistencies.
-Perform EDA to explore relationships between variables, visualize distributions and identify patterns and trends.
-Utilize statistical methods and visualization techniques to gain insights into the data, ultimately facilitating informed decision-making and predictive modeling
